# Eletromagnetic-Wave-Calculator

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description

A simple electromagnetic wave calculator with a terminal menu, developed with Python.<br>
This calculator is a project of the `Modern Physics IV` subject.<br>
Coded in 2021.2 at the [FEI](https://portal.fei.edu.br/) college, located in S√£o Bernardo do Campo/SP/BR.<br>

## üìù Instructions

To run the project, follow these steps:<br>
1 - run the file "main.py"<br>
2 - choose one of the available options.<br>
3 - enter a value.<br>

## üìÉ Obligations

Write a Python language program connected with electromagnetic waves. The program will be of various sizes, so the user's time will have to include menu options to choose the tool he would need for the length of the electric field, etc. ).<br>

The program must be shared among team members: no excuse will be accepted about access to the program if one of the team members misses the class. Each project must be developed on its own time: programs with partial or full plagiarism not considered for evaluation.<br>

General Instructions <br>

‚Ä¢ Outputs with numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãin scientific notation for very large or very small numbers; must have 3 digit results. ‚Ä¢ Physical parameters, both at the input and at the output. ‚Ä¢ Keep in mind all new user-organized items: let them be different menus that are updated for each novapathy and all users. ‚Ä¢ Empathize: After the user is finished, display the options menu again for further studies. (So ‚Äã‚Äãthat the user doesn't have to compile the program each time he wants to do a calculation).

Fun√ß√µes do programa:<br>
Op√ß√£o de entrada para digitar f, Œª, k , ÔÅ∑, Em e Bm. (N√£o esque√ßa de indicar as unidades).)

1. If the user enters the value of f, return::
<br>1.1. The value of Œª.
<br>1.2. The value of k.
<br>1.3. The value of œâ

2. If the user enters the value of Œª, return:
<br>2.1. The value of f.
<br>2.2. The value of k.
<br>2.3. The value of œâ.

3. If the user enters the value of k, return:
<br>3.1. The value of f.
<br>3.2. The value of Œª.
<br>3.3. The value of œâ.

4. If the user enters the value of œâ, return:
<br>4.1. The value of f.
<br>4.2. The value of Œª.
<br>4.3. The value of k.

5. If the user enters the value of the magnetic field, return:
<br>5.1. The value of electric field.

6. If the user enters the value of the electric field, return:
<br>6.1. The value of magnetic field.

It is not mandatory that the calculations are organized in the way shown above. It was organized in this way to serve as a checklist. The important thing is that the program 1) calculates Œª, f, k and œâ from any of the entered wave parameters, which can be either Œª or f or k or œâ. 2) Calculate electric field amplitude and magnetic field.
